Add parent_layout_id to track layout relationships
Add version_metadata: diff_summary, ai_suggestions, user_notes
AI-Powered Version Management
Change detection: Compare layouts and highlight differences using AI analysis
Smart suggestions: "This looks like a minor improvement - create version 1.2" vs "Major redesign detected - create version 2.0"
Automated branching: "Create a mobile version of this layout" → AI generates responsive variant
Rollback assistance: "Revert to the version before I added the contact form"
